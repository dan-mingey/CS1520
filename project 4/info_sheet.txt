Additional comments to the grader:


This budget application only works for whole dollar amounts.  I did not implement it to work for cents.  I have a 1541 exam tomorrow so I am prioritizing studying for that cause GPU's and multithreading are sooOooooOOOooOooOo much fun.  Anyway, thanks for grading! i really enjoyed doing to projects for this class. it really helped put the pieces together of how the internet/web works!
